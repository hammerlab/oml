    Multiclass LDA model by estimating a mean vector for the features (per
    class) and a common covariance matrix (common to all classes), which are
    then used to model a {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution}
    Multivariate normal distribution}. These, per class, distributions are used
    in Bayes's rule for classification. *)

(** Simple one dimensional regression. *)

(** The optional [opt] for univariate regression are weights for each
    observation. One can use them to change the model such that each
    error (e_i) is now sampled from it's own distribution: [N(0, s/w_i)],
    where s^2 is the error variance and w_i is the weight of the ith
    error. *)

(** [alpha t] a shorthand for the constant parameter used in the regression.

(** [beta t] a shorthand for the linear parameter used in the regression.

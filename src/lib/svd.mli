val u : t -> Matrices.t

(** [s t] singular values. *)
val s : t -> Vectors.t

(** [solve_linear a b] solve for [x] in [a x = b] using principal components
    regression, when [a] is the Singular Value Decomposition. *)
val solve_linear : ?lambda:float -> t -> vec -> vec

(** [covariance_matrix_inv t] if [t] is the SVD transform of matrix [A],
    computes the inverse of the covariance matrix: [A^t * A]^-1.
  
    @param [lambda] is an optional [lambda] is an optional value used to scale
    the singular value inverses ala [solve_linear]. *)

(** [looe t y] returns a function to efficiently computes the Leave-One-Out-Error
    vector, for computing the optimal regularization parameter. *)
val looe : t -> vec -> (float -> vec)

(** [h t] computes the Hat matrix of the original matrix passed to Svd. *)
val h : t -> mat

(** [h_diag t] computes the diagonal of the Hat matrix of the original matrix
    passed to Svd. *)

(** Compute statistics (aka estimators) and other methods
    {!val:Descriptive.histogram} that describe data stored in a float array.

    Testing against statistics is found in {Hypothesis_testing}. These
    algorithms are not necessarily tailored for the most accurate algorithms
    that try to minimize truncating (see [Online] for online algorithms) but
    for having a simple function(al) interface with good runtime performance.

(* Central tendency *)

(** [mean data] returns the sample mean of [data]. *)
val mean : float array -> float

(** [median data] returns the number that separates [data] into two halfs of
    equal number where the lower half is less than the [median] and the higher
    half are greater.*)
val median : float array -> float

(** Spread. *)

(** [var data] returns the sample variance of [data].

    @param biased By default the variance calculation is unbiased, via Bessel's
           correction (dividing by [n - 1]), setting the parameter to true will
           divide by [n] instead.

    @param population_mean allows you to calculate the variance against a known
           population mean, and uses the {{!val:mean}sample mean} if not
           specified. *)
val var : ?population_mean:float -> ?biased:bool -> float array -> float

(** [sd data] returns the sample standard deviation of [data].
    Shorthand for to [sqrt (var data)]. See {{!val:var}var} for information
    about optional args.*)
val sd : ?population_mean:float -> ?biased:bool -> float array -> float

(* Between two random variables.*)

(** [covariance x y] computes the sample covariance of [x] and [y] where higher
    positive values indicate a direct relationship (larger values associate with
    larger values, smaller with smaller), a large negative value indicates an
    reverse relationship (smaller with larger and vice versa). While values
    close to 0.0 indicate no relationship.

    @raise Invalid_argument if the size of [x] doesn't equal the size of [y]. *)
val covariance : float array -> float array -> float

(** [correlation x y] returns the Pearson correlation coefficient of [x] and
    [y]. This is normalized sample covariance.

    @raise Invalid_argument if the size of [x] doesn't equal the size of [y]. *)
val correlation : float array -> float array -> float

(** [autocorrelation lag data] computes the correlation of [data] with itself
  offset by [lag].  *)
val autocorrelation : int -> float array -> float

(* Higher moments.*)

(** [moment k data] computes the [k]th sample central moment of [data]. *)
val moment : int -> float array -> float

(** [skew data] computes the sample skew of [data] (Fisher-Pearson's moment
    coefficient of skewness), which is a measure of asymmetry. For unimodal
    data negative values indicate that the left tail is longer in relation
    to the right.

    @param biased The default skew calculation is adjusted to take into
           account sample size. The adjustments are chosen to prefer smaller
           mean squared error for small samples on non-normal distributions
           (See "Comparing measures of sample skewness and kurtosis" Joanes
           1997, for details). Set this parameter to true to ignore these
           adjustments.  *)
val skew : ?biased:bool -> float array -> float

(** [kurtosis data] computes the sample kurtosis of [data]. This is a
    measure of the 'peakedness' vs 'tailness' of a distribution. It is adjusted
    so that a normal distribution will have kurtosis of 0.

    @param biased The default kurtosis calculation is adjusted to take into
           account sample size. The adjustments are chosen to prefer smaller
           mean squared error for small samples on non-normal distributions
           (See "Comparing measures of sample skewness and kurtosis" Joanes
           1997, for details). Set this parameter to true to ignore these
           adjustments.*)
val kurtosis : ?biased:bool -> float array -> float

(* Error of measurements. *)

(** [var_standard_error data] computes the standard error of the variance
    of [data]. The standard error of a statistic (in this case variance)
    is the estimated standard deviation of that statistic. *)
val var_standard_error : float array -> float

(** [skew_standard_error data] computes the standard error of the sample
    (unbiased) skew statistic. *)
val skew_standard_error : float array -> float

(** [kurtosis_standard_error data] computes the standard error of the sample
    (unbiased) kurtosis statistic. *)
val kurtosis_standard_error : float array -> float

(* Statistics *)
(** [var_statistic data] computes the test statistic of the sample variance of
    [data]. This normalizes the variance measurement. *)
val var_statistic : float array -> float

(** [skew_statistic data] computes the test statistic of the sample skew of
    [data]. This normalizes the skew so that it is scale invariant. *)
val skew_statistic : float array -> float

(** [kurtosis_statistic data] computes the test statistic of the sample
    kurtosis of [data]. This normalizes the kurtosis so that it is scale
    invariant. *)
val kurtosis_statistic : float array -> float

type skew_classification =
  [ `Negative | `Slightly_negative | `Normal | `Slightly_positive | `Positive ]

(** [classify_skew data] provides a terse description of the skewness of [data],
    using [-2;-1;1;2] as cut off for the {!skew_classification}.

    Please note, even though a (polymorphic) variant is returned, caution must
    be taken when creating algorithms based upon these classification. These
    methods are brittle in the face of non-normal data and small sample size,
    although effort has been made to choose good practices.  *)

  [ `Skinny | `Slightly_skinny | `Fat | `Slightly_fat | `Normal ]

(** [classify_kurtosis data] provides a terse description of the kurtosis of

    The same warning as in [classify_skew] applies. *)

  }

(** [summary data] summarizes [data] into a [summary].

    @param biased By default all of the statistics are {i unbiased} (sample size
           adjustments are made), set this parameter to true to get the regular
           biased calculations. *)
val summary : ?biased:bool -> float array -> summary

(** [histogram data width_setting] group [data] into a specific number of buckets
    of given width (according to [width_setting]:

    - [`Buckets n] create [n] equally sized bucketes to fit all the data.
    - [`Specific bkts] use [bkts] as lower boundaries on buckets.
    - [`Width w] create buckets of size [w] to fit all the data.

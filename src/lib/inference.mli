(** Infer probabilities from data and perform hypothesis tests. *)

(** [prediction_interval stats alpha]
  Creates a prediction interval for the distribution described by [stats]
  at an [alpha] level of statistical significance; future observations
  will fall within the bounds with probabiltiy [1.0 - alpha].

  When we do not know the mean or standard deviation of a distribution
  we can still create a prediction interval based off of basic sampled
  statistics and Student's distribution.

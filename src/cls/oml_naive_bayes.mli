      @param bernouli if true we treat the underlying distribution as Bernoulli
                      (as opposed to Multinomial) and estimate the likelihood
                      with (1-p_i) for features [i] that are missing from a
                      feature when {{!val:eval}evaluated}.

        {{:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing}Additive smoothing}
        can be applied to the final estimate of Naive Bayes classifiers.
        When estimating a probability distribution by counting observed instances
        in the feature space we may want to smooth the values, particularly if our
        training data is sparse. *)
